This is the working version of the Parsed Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English, based on the [Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/ihd/laeme2/laeme2.html), compiled by Meg Laing at the University of Edinburgh.  PLAEME takes LAEME texts from 1250--1325 and adds syntactic annotation in the format of the [Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/). For information on this format, see [Beatrice Santorini's annotation guidelines](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/annotation/).  As with other Penn-format corpora, the standard way of using PLAEME is to download the psd files and search them with Beth Randall's [CorpusSearch](http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/).

### Work in progress

PLAEME is due for completion in December 2017.  We are releasing this working version because it is now quite big and quite useful, and we would like feedback.  At the same time, it is incomplete and/or inaccurate in many ways.  These are some of the things still on the to-do list:

- More texts are due to be added: two large ones (Northern Homilies, verse *Genesis and Exodus*, edincmbt and genexodt in LAEME) and several small ones. PLAEME currently contains around 150,000 words; when completed, it will be just under 190,000 words.
- There is currently no documentation, beyond this.  For the time being, please refer to PPCHE, LAEME, and CorpusSearch documentation.
- ID nodes need to be added.
- Several forms are missing lemmas (or more precisely, lexels in the LAEME sense), or need better lemmas (for numerals and proper names).
- Splitting and joining of words needs to be made more uniform.
- Formatting of languages other than English is currently incorrect.

If you spot issues other than these, please let us know.

### Acknowledgements

This work is funded by a British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grant (Robert Truswell PI).  It has benefitted enormously from Meg Laing's textual advice.  The project was conceived during a British Council researcher links workshop in Campinas, Brazil, organized by Susan Pintzuk and Charlotte Galves.  Susan Pintzuk and Aaron Ecay provided invaluable advice on the early stages during a research visit to York (August 2015).  Beatrice Santorini shared her revision queries and provided guidance on the PPCHE format.
